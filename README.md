# Foreign Language Keyboard Helper
Type characters from foreign languages without having to change your keyboard layout in Windows.

Currently supported languages:
Only German so far. Other languages coming soon(TM).

Press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+U to bring up the UI for language selection.

Once you pick something other than "Default" (your default keyboard language - with this option picked, you won't have access to any additional characters), you'll be able to type characters from that language while keeping your original keyboard functionality. Press AltGr (the right alt button) + the corresponding character to type its foreign language version (e.g. "o" with AltGr becomes "รถ" while German is selected).

Press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+E if you wish to exit the program (this can also be done using the tray icon).

This is an AutoHotkey (AHK) program, meaning that it will only run on Windows operating systems (definitely Windows 10, probably XP and up).

Installation:
1. Download AutoHotkey v1.1 https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Download Foreign-Language-Keyboard-Helper.ahk from this repository and run it. Done.
