# Foreign Language Keyboard Helper
Type characters from foreign languages without having to change keyboard language.

Press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+U to bring up the UI for language selection.

Once you pick something other than "Default" (your default keyboard language), you'll be able to type characters from that language while keeping your original keyboard functionality.

Press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+E if you wish to exit the program (or use the tray icon).

This is an AutoHotkey (AHK) program, meaning that it will only run on Windows operating systems (Definitely Windows 10, probably XP and up).
