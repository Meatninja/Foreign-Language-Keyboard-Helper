# Foreign Language Keyboard Helper
Type characters from foreign languages without having to change keyboard language.

Currently supported languages:
Only German so far. Other languages coming soon(TM).

Press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+U to bring up the UI for language selection.

Once you pick something other than "Default" (your default keyboard language - with this option picked, you won't have access to any additional characters), you'll be able to type characters from that language while keeping your original keyboard functionality. Press right Alt + the corresponding character to type its foreign language version (e.g. "o" with right Alt becomes "รถ" while German is selected).

Experimental feature: if you are on the Duolingo page for German lessons (possibly other languages too - untested), you can use the keys F1, F2, F3 and F4 to press the buttons that let you listen to speech without using the mouse. Works based on screen coordinates - best used with a maximized Firefox window.

Press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+E if you wish to exit the program (this can also be done using the tray icon).

This is an AutoHotkey (AHK) program, meaning that it will only run on Windows operating systems (definitely Windows 10, probably XP and up).

Manual installation: Download and run the .ahk file. Done.
