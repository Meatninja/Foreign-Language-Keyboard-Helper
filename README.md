# Foreign Language Keyboard Helper
Type characters from foreign languages without having to change keyboard language.

Press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+U to bring up the UI for language selection.

Once you pick something other than "Default" (your default keyboard language), you'll be able to type characters from that language while keeping your original keyboard functionality.

Experimental feature: if you are on the DuoLingo page for learning German, you can use the keys F1, F2, F3 and F4 to press the buttons that let you listen to speech *without using the mouse*.

Press Ctrl+Shift+Alt+E if you wish to exit the program (or use the tray icon).

This is an AutoHotkey (AHK) program, meaning that it will only run on Windows operating systems (Definitely Windows 10, probably XP and up).
